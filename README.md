# CoordsDB
A plugin for saving coordinates for the Paper Minecraft Server.

Have you ever found yourself hitting F3 to get into that cluttered debug menu to save the coordinates of an important place such as your home base or nether portal? Maybe you have a whole album of screenshots or a Google Doc with all your coordinates. What if, there was a simpler in-game solution for saving your coordinates and getting easily all without leaving your game by using a few simple commands? 

That is why I created this plugin.

## Supported Platforms
- 1.19 Paper Minecraft Server

## How to use

- `/coords:get <label>` Gets the coordinate location with the specified label
